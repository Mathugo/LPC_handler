# LPC_handler
Handler of the C++ Projet LPC

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine

### Prerequisites

It's recommended to use the handler on a linux machine, so you can easily access 
to the handler by using SSH, but you can build this project with Visual Studio.


### Installing and building
You will need to have github on your local machine

## Windows :
Just clone the github repo and build the project with Visual Studio or with g++, example : 
```
g++ all_your_cpp_files -o handler -std=c++11
```
Then execute it. It is important that you put all your files you want to upload in the futur on the Zombies, in the same directory as the executable

## Linux :
Just clone the gitjub repo and build the project : 
```
git init
git clone https://github.com/Mathugo/LPC_handler.git
git pull
cd LPC_handler
chmod +x RUN.sh 
./RUN.sh
```

## Running the tests 
No tests are plannified for the moments
